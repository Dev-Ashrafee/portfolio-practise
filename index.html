          Hi, I'm Ashrafee, a web developer who is crazy about coding. I love to
          experiment with new technologies, and I'm always looking for new
          challenges. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, but I always try to do my
          best. I'm also a bit of a dreamer, and I'm always looking for new ways
          to make the world a better place through technology. I'm not sure what
          I want to do with my life, but I know I want to do something that
          makes a difference.
        </p>
